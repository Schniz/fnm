> :rocket: Fast and simple Node.js version manager, built in ReasonML

</div>

## Features
:sparkles: Single file, easy installation

:rocket: Built with speed in mind

:thinking: Works with `.nvmrc` files

## Installation

* Download the [latest release binary](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm/releases) for your system
* Make it available globally on `$PATH`
* Add the following line to your `.bashrc`/`.zshrc` file:

  ```bash
  eval `fnm env`
  ```

  If you are using [fish shell](https://fishshell.com/), add this line to your `config.fish` file:

  ```fish
  eval (fnm env --fish)
  ```

## Usage

You can always use `fnm --help` to read the docs:

### `fnm install [VERSION]`

Installs `[VERSION]`. If no version provided, it will install the version specified in the `.nvmrc` file located in the current working directory.

### `fnm use [VERSION]`

Activates `[VERSION]` as the current Node version. If no version provided, it will activate the version specified in the `.nvmrc` file located in the current working directory.

### `fnm ls`

Lists the installed Node versions.

### `fnm ls-remote`

Lists the Node versions available to download remotely.

### `fnm env [--fish]`

Prints the required shell commands in order to configure your shell, Bash compliant by default. Provide `--fish` to output the Fish-compliant version.

## Future Plans
- [ ] Add a simpler way of installing it (`curl | bash`?)
- [ ] Feature: make versions complete the latest: `10` would infer the latest minor and patch versions of node 10. `10.1` would infer the latest patch version of node 10.1
- [ ] Feature: `fnm use --install`, `fnm use --quiet`
- [ ] Feature: `fnm install lts`?
- [ ] Feature: `fnm alias`?
- [ ] Feature: Consider nvm-like per-shell usage with symlinks on `/tmp` directory
- [ ] OSX: Add to homebrew?
- [ ] Windows Support?
- [ ] Linux: Replace `curl` usage with `cohttp`/`ocurl` or something else which is statically-linkable
- [ ] Linux: Replace `tar` with a statically linked library too (for ungzip + untar)
