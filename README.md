## Features

:earth_americas: Cross-platform support (Mac, Windows, Linux)

:sparkles: Single file, easy installation, instant startup

:rocket: Built with speed in mind

:thinking: Works with `.node-version` and `.nvmrc` files

## Installation

### Using a script (MacOS/Linux)

> :wave: Hey, I'm sorry that the automated way does not support Windows yet. Feel free to contribute it! Maybe [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) or [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/)?

For `bash`, `zsh` and `fish` shells, there's an [automatic installation script](./.ci/install.sh):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://fnm.vercel.app/install | bash
```

#### Upgrade

On OSX, it is a simple as `brew upgrade Schniz/tap/fnm`.

On other operating systems, upgrading `fnm` is almost the same as installing it. To prevent duplication in your shell config file add `--skip-shell` to install command.

#### Parameters

`--install-dir`

Set a custom directory for fnm to be installed. The default is `$HOME/.fnm`.

`--skip-shell`

Skip appending shell specific loader to shell config file, based on the current user shell, defined in `$SHELL`. e.g. for Bash, `$HOME/.bashrc`. `$HOME/.zshrc` for Zsh. For Fish - `$HOME/.config/fish/conf.d/fnm.fish`

`--force-install`

MacOS installations using the installation script are deprecated in favor of the Homebrew formula, but this forces the script to install using it anyway.

Example:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://fnm.vercel.app/install | bash -s -- --install-dir "./.fnm" --skip-shell
```

### Manually (OSX/Linux/Windows)

#### Using Homebrew (OSX)

[This is a custom tap I'm maintaining](https://github.com/Schniz/homebrew-tap), and will be used until fnm will move to the official one.

```bash
brew install Schniz/tap/fnm
```

Then apply the changes the installer prints, to set up your shell profile.

#### Using a release binary (Linux/Mac/Windows)

- Download the [latest release binary](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm/releases) for your system
- Make it available globally on `PATH` environment variable
- Configure your shell profile:

  - For **Bash** or **Zsh** users, add the following to your `.bashrc`/`.zshrc` respectively:

    ```bash
    eval "$(fnm env)"
    ```

  - For [**Fish Shell**](https://fishshell.com/) users, create `~/.config/fish/conf.d/fnm.fish` add this line to it:

    ```fish
    fnm env | source
    ```

  - For **PowerShell** users, add the following to the end of your profile file::

    ```powershell
    fnm env --use-on-cd | Out-String | Invoke-Expression
    ```

    - On Windows, the profile is located at `~\Documents\PowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1`
    - For Mac/Linux, the profile is located at `~/.config/powershell/Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1`

  - For **WinCMD**, aka good old **Windows Command Prompt** or **Batch**, fnm is also supported but is not entirely covered. [You can set up a startup script](https://superuser.com/a/144348) and append the following line:

    ```
    FOR /f "tokens=*" %i IN ('fnm env --use-on-cd') DO CALL %i
    ```

## Completions

fnm ships its completions with the binary:

```
fnm completions --shell <SHELL>
```

Where `<SHELL>` can be one of the supported shells:

- `bash`
- `zsh`
- `fish`
- `powershell`

Please follow your shell instructions to install them.

## Usage

### Global Options

```
fnm [--shell=fish|bash|zsh] [--node-dist-mirror=URI] [--fnm-dir=DIR] [--log-level=quiet|error|info] <command>
```

- Providing `--shell=fish` will output the Fish-compliant version. Omitting it and `fnm` will try to infer the current shell based on the process tree
- Providing `--node-dist-mirror="https://npm.taobao.org/dist"` will use the Chinese mirror of Node.js
- Providing `--fnm-dir="/tmp/fnm"` will install and use versions in `/tmp/fnm` directory

You can always use `fnm --help` to read the docs:

### `fnm install [VERSION]`

Installs `[VERSION]`. If no version provided, it will install the version specified in the `.node-version` or `.nvmrc` files located in the current working directory.

### `fnm install --lts`

Installs the latest LTS version of Node

### `fnm use [VERSION]`

Activates `[VERSION]` as the current Node version. If no version provided, it will activate the version specified in the `.node-version` or `.nvmrc` file located in the current working directory.

#### Flags

- `--install-if-missing` â€” installs the version if it isn't installed yet

### `fnm current`

Display currently activated Node version.

### `fnm ls`

Lists the installed Node versions.

### `fnm ls-remote`

Lists the Node versions available to download remotely.

### `fnm uninstall [VERSION]`

Uninstalls the node version specified in `[VERSION]`.

### `fnm alias [VERSION] [NAME]`

Aliases a Node version to a given name.

### `fnm default [VERSION]`

Aliases a Node version as default. Uses `fnm alias` underneath.

### `fnm env`

Prints the required shell commands in order to configure your shell, Bash compliant if can't infer the shell. This command is highly influenced by [the global options](#global-options)

#### Options:

- `--use-on-cd` will also output a script that will automatically change the node version if a `.node-version`/`.nvmrc` file is found
