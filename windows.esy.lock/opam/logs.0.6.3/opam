synopsis: """Logging infrastructure for OCaml"""
description: """\

Logs provides a logging infrastructure for OCaml. Logging is performed
on sources whose reporting level can be set independently. Log message
report is decoupled from logging and is handled by a reporter.

A few optional log reporters are distributed with the base library and
the API easily allows to implement your own.

`Logs` has no dependencies. The optional `Logs_fmt` reporter on OCaml
formatters depends on [Fmt][fmt].  The optional `Logs_browser`
reporter that reports to the web browser console depends on
[js_of_ocaml][jsoo]. The optional `Logs_cli` library that provides
command line support for controlling Logs depends on
[`Cmdliner`][cmdliner]. The optional `Logs_lwt` library that provides
Lwt logging functions depends on [`Lwt`][lwt]

Logs and its reporters are distributed under the ISC license.
