description: """
Lambda Soup is an HTML scraping library inspired by Python's Beautiful Soup. It
provides lazy traversals from HTML nodes to their parents, children, siblings,
etc., and to nodes matching CSS selectors. The traversals can be manipulated
using standard functional combinators such as fold, filter, and map.

The DOM tree is mutable. You can use Lambda Soup for automatic HTML rewriting in
scripts. Lambda Soup rewrites its own ocamldoc page this way.

A major goal of Lambda Soup is to be easy to use, including in interactive
sessions, and to have a minimal learning curve. It is a very simple library.
