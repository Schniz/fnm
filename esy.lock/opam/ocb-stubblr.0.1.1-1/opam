synopsis: "OCamlbuild plugin for C stubs"
description: """
Do you get excited by C stubs? Do they sometimes make you swoon, and even faint,
and in the end no `cmxa`s get properly linked -- not to mention correct
multi-lib support?

Do you wish that the things that excite you the most, would excite you just a
little less? Then ocb-stubblr is just the library for you.

ocb-stubblr is about ten lines of code that you need to repeat over, over, over
and over again if you are using `ocamlbuild` to build OCaml projects that
contain C stubs -- now with 100% more lib!

It does what everyone wants to do with `.clib` files in their project
directories. It can also clone the `.clib` and arrange for multiple compilations
with different sets of discovered `cflags`.

ocb-stubblr is distributed under the ISC license."""
