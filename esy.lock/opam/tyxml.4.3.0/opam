synopsis:"TyXML is a library for building correct HTML and SVG documents"
description:"""
TyXML provides a set of convenient combinators that uses the OCaml
type system to ensure the validity of the generated documents. TyXML
can be used with any representation of HTML and SVG: the textual one,
provided directly by this package, or DOM trees (`js_of_ocaml-tyxml`)
virtual DOM (`virtual-dom`) and reactive or replicated trees
(`eliom`). You can also create your own representation and use it to
instantiate a new set of combinators.

```ocaml
open Tyxml
let to_ocaml = Html.(a ~a:[a_href "ocaml.org"] [txt "OCaml!"])
```
